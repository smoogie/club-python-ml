# Intro
This repository contains materials that are used for the Python/ML Club initiatives.
Python/ML Club is an open initiative for people who want to learn ML with Python. The idea behind it is to have a self-organized group that together learns and explores Python and ML. The group meets regularly physically and supports each other in learning. Participants take turns to present new topics and help others practice newly accumulated knowledge.

This repo contains materials that can help in club organization and meeting execution. It also can be used for self-learning outside any group.

# Repo structure
The repository contains the following directories:
- Club organization - here, you can find materials on organizing clubs, suggestions on arranging meetings, etc.
- Learn - Some exercises that should help you and your club mates learn specific topics and libraries. Most of the materials contain explanations and examples, with some space to write code yourself.
- Practice - some "homework" projects that you and your club mates can do to practice more on newly acquired knowledge. There will be no explanations or examples compared to the materials from the "learn" directory. You get a data set and a specific goal to reach. In some cases, you can be provided with results to compare.
- Slides - slides for talks/presentations that can be used during meetings. To use them, you still need to understand the topic to explain it to your teammates.

# Requirements
For any labs/exercises, you need to install Python3 with a pipe and Jupiter. You should also have some basic knowledge of Python.

Python 3 - https://www.python.org/downloads/
Jupyter - https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html
