It is very important to define the form that the club will take. There are many different approaches and many different things to consider. When you define the form, align it with all participants and put in one place as part of your club manifesto. Make sure that you have some space to communicate (for example, Slack, teams, WhatsApp) and keep all your organizational documents in one place (for example, Github repo, Google Docs, etc.)

What to consider:
- Regularity of the meeting - when, how often? Weekly/biweekly/monthly or irregular? Is the specific day of the week/month irregular?
- Location: online or physical. If online, what tool is used for meeting and sharing materials? If physical, where and how do you organize space for the meeting?
- The number of participants—should it be limited, or not? Is it a static number, or does it change often? Should it be split into smaller groups if too many people participate?
- Goal - do you want to learn together and explore new possibilities? Or do you want to achieve a specific goal and solve a specific problem? Do you want to explore different issues, solutions, and tools, or do you want to learn very specific things?
- Level of participants - do you all start from the same place? Where do you start, from learning basics to jumping to more specific issues? Should you split the club into groups based on advancement level, or maybe have a few introduction sessions to equalize the level between participants?
- Meeting forms - Who will present the theory and practice, and how will it be presented? Would you include some talks/presentations or only exercises? Would you focus only on doing projects or exercises? Would you do general projects or real life projects? How time will be split between theory and practice?
- Club members engagement — how would members be engaged? Would they participate in meeting organization? Would they participate in preparing the material? In what order and who will do what? Would it be voluntary for people to "prepare" and co-organize meetings, or would everyone, in turn, be responsible for preparing some topics?

### Example of form definition
We organize semi-regular meetings. At the end of each meeting, we align on the next date of the meeting. There should not be more than three weeks between meetings.

Each meeting starts with a presentation/talk prepared by a club member. The presentation is a theoretical introduction to the topic that we will cover during the meeting. It should explain the topic and give participants basic knowledge. After the presentation and short discussion, club members work with the code to practice the knowledge they have acquired. During practice, club members should support each other and suggest improvements to exercises. 

Most of the exercises should be prepared as a Jupyter Notebook. From time to time, instead of talking and exercising, the club does some projects to practice the knowledge acquired during previous meetings. Some projects will be bigger exercises based on public datasets, and others can be more practical. 

Practical project may have two forms: open source project or company project. Both should come from the club members as idea on some practical application on real life problems.

Talks should take 20-30 minutes. Exercises should be prepared for 20-60 minutes, depending on the topic.

Working on projects should be split into a few meetings and "homework". Homework gives club members the opportunity to follow up on the project and maintain momentum. Also, meetings for projects should be organized more often and focused on bottlenecks, issues, discussions, and sharing experiences. The first meeting of the sequence should be an introduction to the project: what, why, and how we want to do it. It should end with a plan for the project and a general skeleton for the code.
