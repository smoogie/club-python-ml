Jupyter notebooks available here are sample labs that you and your club can use as exercises during your meetings. Review them before using them and make sure that at least one of club members is able to explain things presented there and help others in practice.

Please make sure that you have Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed on your machines.

To load fast-start labs, open jupyter lab with the current directory:
```
jupyter lab .
```
